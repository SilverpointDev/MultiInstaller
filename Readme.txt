Getting Started
---------------

To install a component pack with MultiInstaller you have to follow these steps:
1) Read the licenses of the component packs you want to install.
2) Get the zip files of component packs.
3) Get the Silverpoint MultiInstaller.
4) Get the Setup.ini file for that component pack installation or create one.

For example, if you want to install TB2K + SpTBXLib:
1) Create a new folder for the installation.
2) Download all the component zips to the created folder: SpTBXLib + TB2K + TB2K Patch
3) Download the MultiInstaller
4) Download the Setup.Ini file, unzip it in the folder.

The installation folder will end up with this files:

C:\MyInstall
       |-  SpTBXLib.zip
       |-  tb2k-2.2.2.zip
       |-  TB2Kpatch-1.1.zip
       |-  MultiInstaller.exe
       |-  Setup.ini

You are ready to install the component packages, just run the MultiInstaller, select the destination folder, and all the components will be unziped, patched, compiled and installed on the Delphi IDE.
